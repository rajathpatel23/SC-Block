59769828,,Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with BioPQQ (30 Softgels),"Life Extension continues to develop increasingly potent mitochondria-boosting formulations.The new Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with BioPQQ® contains shilajit (which studies have shown doubles CoQ10 levels in the mitochondria) plus the breakthrough compound PQQ(shown to support the spontaneous generation of new mitochondriain aging cells). This represents a three-way strategy for enhanced mitochondrial support.Super Ubiquinol CoQ10CoQ10 is required to convert the energy from fats and sugars you eat into usable cellular energy. More people are supplementing with CoQ10 than ever before. A key reason is increased awareness that the body’s production of CoQ10 declines significantly with advancing age.5Statin drugs also deplete CoQ10 levels in the blood, and possibly, tissues. For example, statin drugs reduce plasma CoQ10 by almost 40%—but the aging process itself reduces CoQ10 levels in the heart muscle wall by 72%.Studies show that absorption of the ubiquinol form of CoQ10 is far greater than the conventional ubiquinone form. In middle-aged mice, ubiquinolwas shown to be 40% more effective in slowing measurements of aging, compared to ubiquinone.Life Extension offers this highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of patented CoQ10 in an advanced delivery system, providing an unparalleled absorption level.Enhanced Support with ShilajitPrimaVie shilajithas been shown to doublelevels of CoQ10 in mitochondria.Combining CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in energy production in the brain—40% betterthan CoQ10 alone. And in muscle, there was a 144% increasein energy production—27% better than CoQ10 alone.Shilajit boosts CoQ10’s beneficial effects by stabilizing CoQ10 in the superior ubiquinol form.Additionally, shilajit facilitates more efficient delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria, which results in greater cellular energy production.Shilajit itself is rich in essential compounds that help the mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the body’s main source of energy.PQQ Promotes Growth of New MitochondriaUntil recently, the only options for aging individuals to promote replenishment of the declining numbers of mitochondria in their bodies were long-term calorie restriction or exhaustive physical activity—difficult or impractical for most aging people. Now PQQoffers a viable alternative: PQQ(pyrroloquinoline quinone) promotes spontaneous production of new mitochondria.In fact, PQQ promotes youthful cellular function in three distinct ways:Promotes mitochondrial biogenesis.PQQ activates genes that promote the formation of fresh mitochondria.It also beneficially interacts with genes directly involved in mitochondrial health. These same genes support healthy body weight, normal fat and sugar metabolism and youthful cellular proliferation.Mitochondrial defense.Mitochondria possess their own DNA, distinct from those contained in the cell nucleus. Unfortunately, compared to nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA are relatively unprotected—and yet situated at the source of both energy and free-radical production. PQQ’s antioxidant potency and favorable gene-expression profile powerfully boost mitochondrial defense.Antioxidant power. PQQ is a potent antioxidant. Its extraordinary molecular stability enables it to facilitate thousands of antioxidant reactions in the mitochondria—without breaking down—for maximum antioxidant and bioenergetic support.PQQ is an essential nutrient, meaning that your body cannot make it on its own. A wealth of research demonstrates that—alone and especially in combination with CoQ10—its unique nutritional profile supports heart health and brain function.This should be no surprise, given how much energy these vital organs need.Life Extension has identified a purified, highly potent form of PQQ from Japan that is produced through a unique fermentation process. The result is some of the highest quality PQQ available today.Serving Size:1 Softgel Servings per Container:30Amount per Serving:Ubiquinol (as Kaneka QH Ubiquinol)100 mgPrimaVie Shilajit fulvic acid complex100 mgBioPQQ Pyrroloquinoline quinone disodium salt10 mgOther Ingredients:Medium chain triglycerides oil, gelatin, glycerin, purified water, sunflower lecithin, annatto color, beeswax, rosemary extract.",3.75E1,USD,,2901340

870762,,Sigma 20mm F1.4 DG HSM Art Lens [Nikon],"Truly wide and truly fast, the Nikon F mount 20mm f/1.4 DG HSM Lens is a member of the venerable Art series of Global Vision lenses from Sigma and pairs a sophisticated optical design with a robust physical construction. Comprised of 15 elements in 11 groups, the lens design includes two \""F\"" Low Dispersion (FLD) elements, five Special Low Dispersion (SLD) elements, and two aspherical elements to significantly reduce chromatic and spherical aberrations, as well as limit distortion for clean, sharp, and evenly illuminated imagery. A Super Multi-Layer Coating has also been applied to minimize surface reflections, flare, and ghosting for increased contrast and color accuracy. The wide focal length and consistent image quality make this lens especially suitable for landscape, interior, architectural, and astrophotography applications, while the fast f/1.4 maximum aperture deems it ideal for natural and low-light shooting.Complementing the optical performance is an equally adept Hyper Sonic Motor, which provides fast, smooth, and near-silent autofocus performance. This focusing motor also enables full-time manual focus override at any time just by rotating the focus ring for refined manual control and focusing as close as 10.9\"". The lens barrel is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite material, which supports working in a wide variety of temperatures and conditions, and the lens mount is constructed from brass for long-term durability and mounting accuracy. Additionally, this lens is also compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuned control over focusing parameters and other lens characteristics.As part of the Art line within Sigma's Global Vision series, this lens' is designed to achieve truly notable optical performance and is ideally suited for creative and artistic applications.Prime wide-angle 20mm f/1.4 lens is designed for FX format Nikon F mount DSLRs, and can also be used with DX models where it will provide a 30mm equivalent focal length.Fast f/1.4 maximum aperture is well-suited for working in low-light conditions and also provides greater control over the focus position when using shallow depth of field techniques.Two FLD, five SLD, and two aspherical elements have been incorporated within the lens design to correct for chromatic aberrations throughout the entire focusing range and help to ensure high image sharpness, clarity, and contrast regardless of focus point or aperture setting. This optical design also helps to control distortion and limit vignetting.A Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to lens elements in order to minimize lens flare and ghosting and contribute to producing contrast-rich and color-neutral imagery, even in backlit conditions.The integrated HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) realizes quick and quiet autofocusing, which is further complemented by an optimized AF algorithm to produce smoother focusing performance. The HSM also permits full-time manual focus control simply by rotating the focus ring at any time.A rounded nine-blade diaphragm helps to produce an attractive out-of-focus quality.Fixed petal-shaped lens hood helps to reduce lens flare when working in strong lighting conditions and also offers some protection to the front element of the lens.The lens is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite (TSC) material, along with traditional metals, for greater precision and use in wide temperature variations.The bayonet mount is constructed from brass for ensured accuracy and durability.This lens is compatible with the optional Sigma USB Dock for fine-tuning different lens characteristics and updating its firmware.In the Box",899.00,USD,,2318450

10250400,,Nikon 300mm f4E PF AF-S NIKKOR ED VR Lens,"Big and powerful, but not so big that it will give you a hernia. In fact, far from it. This relatively compact prime telephoto lens will bring all you survey closer to you. Ideal for events where discretion is key, and high-speed is required. A must for events including sports.F-Mount Lens/FX FormatAperture Range: f/4 to f/32One Phase Fresnel ElementOne Extra-Low Dispersion ElementNano Crystal & Super Integrated CoatingsFluorine-Coated Front Lens ElementSilent Wave Motor AF SystemVibration Reduction, Sport/Tripod ModesElectromagnetic Diaphragm MechanismRounded 9-Blade DiaphragmThe power of a Phase Fresnel lens in a revolutionary 300mm.Introducing a thrilling new 300mm f/4 prime lens capable of changing the way pro and serious enthusiasts shoot. At just 147.5mm long and 755g—over 30% shorter and 1.5lbs lighter than its predecessor—the AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is the world's lightest 300mm full-frame AF lens. (As of January 5, 2015. Statement based on Nikon research.) The secret to its remarkable size? A Nikon-designed Phase Fresnel (PF) lens element, a first for the NIKKOR DSLR lens line-up. But handling isn't the only advantage; the PF element also performs brilliantly—achieve new levels of sharpness and clarity with virtually no chromatic aberration or ghosting. Whether you shoot fashion, portraits, nature, wildlife, sports, action or today's big stories, the AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR will help you capture stunning views of the decisive moment.Thrilling optical performanceThe AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is a cutting-edge lens engineered to draw peak performance from high-resolution full-frame cameras. The Phase Fresnel element nearly eliminates chromatic aberration on its own. When combined with an Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass element and Nano Crystal Coat (N), it delivers strikingly clear, accurate images. Nikon's Silent Wave Motor (SWM) provides ultra-quiet, ultra-fast autofocusing with seamless manual override (just spin the focusing ring), and a Fluorine coating on the front lens element effectively repels dust, water, grease or dirt, ensuring easy cleaning.Speed, precision and versatilityThe AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is a quintessential prime lens that belongs in the serious photographer's bag. Its fast f/4 maximum aperture and rounded nine-blade diaphragm produce beautiful bokeh. A highly accurate electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism ensures consistent exposures, especially when shooting at high frame rates. And for greater reach, the AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR is compatible with most Nikon Tele-converters. Work in nearly any light, at any distance, with outstanding sharpness and contrast.4.5 stops of Vibration ReductionThe AF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR's Vibration Reduction (VR) feature provides an image stabilizing effect equivalent to a shutter speed increase of 4.5 stops (in NORMAL mode; based on CIPA Standard). Capture sharp, clear handheld images in low light, of fast action and more. VR modes specifically designed for Sports & Action and Tripod Shooting deliver specialized image stabilization to match your situation.A/MA/M stands for Auto-Priority Manual Mode. This mode also enables an easy transition from autofocus to manual during AF operation. However, mode switch sensitivity has been altered to reduce the possibility of sudden unintentional switching to manual focus while shooting.Electromagnetic Diaphragm MechanismAn electromagnetic diaphragm mechanism in the lens barrel provides highly accurate electronic diaphragm or aperture blade control when using auto exposure during continuous shooting. With conventional D/G type lenses, the diaphragm blades are operated by mechanical linkage levers.ED (Extra-Low Dispersion) GlassAn optical glass developed by Nikon that is used with normal optical glass in telephoto lenses to obtain optimum correction of chromatic aberrations.IF LensA NIKKOR lens in which only the internal lens group shifts during focusing. Thus, IF NIKKORS do not change in size during AF operation, allowing for compact, lightweight lenses capable of closer focusing distances. These lenses will be designated with the abbreviation IF on the lens barrel.M/ASelect NIKKOR lenses have a focusing mode which allows switching from automatic to manual focusing with virtually no lag time by simply turning the focusing ring on the lens. This makes it possible to seamlessly switch to fine manual focusing while looking through the viewfinder.Nano Crystal CoatAn anti-reflective coating developed by Nikon that virtually eliminates internal lens element reflections across a wide range of wavelengths. Nano Crystal Coat solves ghost effects caused by red light and effectively reduces ghost and flare caused by light entering the lens diagonally.Phase FresnelPhase Fresnel (PF) lens elements effectively compensate for chromatic aberration and ghosting when combined with ordinary glass lens elements. The PF lens element is based upon the Phase Fresnel lens, which appears to have a series of concentric circles engraved onto it. Utilizing a Phase Fresnel lens element allows Nikon engineers to use fewer lens elements, resulting in a more compact and lightweight lens. Due to the characteristics of a PF (Phase Fresnel) lens that utilizes the photo diffraction phenomenon, when there is a strong light source within the frame or when light enters the lens from outside of the frame, ring-shaped coloured flare may occur according to shooting conditions. This phenomenon can be minimized with “PF Flare Control” to be included in Capture NX-D (ver.1.1.0 or later). For more information, see software Help/manual. Capture NX-D is available from the Nikon website. Be sure to keep your software up to date.Silent Wave MotorAF-S NIKKOR lenses feature Nikon’s Silent Wave Motor (SWM). This technology converts “traveling waves” into rotational energy to focus the optics. This enables high-speed autofocusing that's extremely accurate and super quiet.Super Integrated CoatingNikon Super Integrated Coating is Nikon's term for its multilayer coating of the optical elements in NIKKOR lenses.Vibration ReductionA Nikon in-lens technology that improves image stability by automatically compensating for camera shake. Lenses that offer VR will feature the abbreviation VR on the lens barrel.",1649,GBP,,677220

A pocket fountain pen which everyone could carry anywhere. Just 10.5 cm big when closed, and with the cap on top of the barrel it grew to a standard size pen. Small in the pocket and big in the hand: The Kaweco Sport.Sepp Herberger already appreciated these characteristics.

15911331,,Sony Alpha a9 II Mirrorless Digital Camera Body,"The second generation of speed, theSony Alpha a9 IItakes the impressive feature-set of its predecessor and adds enhanced connectivity, a refined body design, and even quicker performance. Utilizing the proven 24.2MP full-frame Exmor RS BSI stacked CMOS sensor and an updated BIONZ X processor, the a9 II sports especially quick and responsive capabilities. Up to 20 fps shooting is possible with a silent electronic shutter or up to 10 fps with a mechanical shutter is supported, along with a wide sensitivity range that reaches up to an expanded ISO 204800. The sensor's design also incorporates a 693-point phase-detection autofocus system, which offers intelligent subject tracking and Real-time Eye AF to ensure critical focus on moving subjects. The BIONZ X also performs up to 60 AF/AE functions per second to go along with the 20 fps shooting for reliable results in quickly changing situations. In addition to stills, UHD 4K video recording is supported at up to 30 fps and Quick and Slow Motion recording is also available. Additionally, 5-axis SteadyShot INSIDE sensor-shift image stabilization is available, too, which minimizes the appearance of camera shake by up to 5.5 stops.Benefitting the imaging capabilities, the a9 II receives a dramatic update in its physical design, featuring a more ergonomic body shape, refined weather sealing, and improved connectivity. A 3.69m-dot OLED EVF provides a bright, clear eye-level viewing means and affords blackout-free viewing to support photographing at high continuous speeds. The rear 3.0\"" 1.44m-dot tilting LCD has a touchscreen design, too, for intuitive control over shooting settings and playback. Dual UHS-II SD memory card slots permit flexible file storage and the a9 II has been fitted with an improved 1000BASE-T Ethernet port for faster wired LAN sharing and remote camera operation. 5.0 GHz wireless sharing and Bluetooth are integrated, as well, for wireless sharing and remote camera control. Additionally, Voice Memos enables you to record up to 60-second sound clips with each photo, which can then be automatically converted to text, using the Transfer & Tagging app add-on, and then embedded into files' metadata.24.2MP Exmor RS BSI Stacked CMOS Sensor and BIONZ X Image ProcessorBuilt for speed, the a9 II utilizes a 24.2MP Exmor RS BSI stacked CMOS sensor, along with an updated BIONZ X image processor, that yields impressively quick and responsive performance. Up to 20 fps continuous shooting is possible using an electronic shutter or 10 fps shooting is supported with a mechanical shutter. The sensor's back-illuminated design also affords high sensitivity to an extended ISO 204800 with reduced noise for clean image quality in a variety of lighting conditions. Additionally, uncompressed raw files can be recorded in 14-bit for greater color fidelity and post-production flexibility.The BIONZ X processor also works in conjunction with a high-speed front-end LSI to realize faster processing times along with a wide dynamic range with smooth tonal rendering. Benefitting the fast recording capabilities is an equally quick AF/AE metering system that functions at 60 times per second to continuously evaluate the scene in order to lock onto and track moving subjects. Automatic anti-flicker shooting also recognizes and times the shutter action to minimize the flicker effect for more consistent results on still images. Additionally, due to the use of an electronic shutter, totally blackout-free monitoring is possible with the electronic viewfinder for more accurate compositions of moving subjects.Fast Hybrid AF SystemCovering 93% of the image area, a Fast Hybrid AF system incorporates 693 phase-detection points along with 425 contrast-detection areas for quick and precise focusing in a variety of lighting conditions with sensitivity down to -3 EV. The density of focusing points from this hybrid AF system also enables High-density Tracking AF Technology, which is adept at tracking moving subjects in a variety of lighting conditions. Updated AF algorithms also benefit maintaining critical focus on erratically or unpredictably moving subjects. Additionally, the use of phase-detection points enables the use of A-mount lenses via the optional LA-EA3 or LA-EA1 lens mount adapters with full continuous AF/AE tracking compatibility.The apt focus system also lends itself to a variety of focusing functions for refined accuracy, including Lock-on AF, which maintains focus on moving subjects throughout the use of a configurable frame that is set over the desired moving subject, and Expand Flexible Spot, which employs neighboring focus points to retain focus on moving subjects even if the originally selected point loses focus. The focus frame color is selectable, between white and red, and AF tracking is possible with apertures narrower than f/16 with select lenses when working in Focus Priority mode. Additionally, Eye AF can be used to base focus on recognized human subjects' eyes for portraits and is available in both AF-S and AF-C modes, for both stills and video. Eye AF can be used when photographing animal subjects, too, with any focusing mode when shooting stills. Autofocus can also be used in conjunction with the Focus Magnifier function for critical focus when homing in on minute subject details. The rear touchscreen can also be used for Touch Focus control, and a Touchpad Focus Control mode lets you use the rear screen intuitively while keeping your eye to the viewfinder.

The screen also tilts upward and downward to benefit working from high and low angles.Magnesium alloy chassis assures rigidity, durability, and stability while remaining lightweight. The lens mount has also been improved to better support heavy lenses, and the grip rigidity has been improved for more comfortable hand-holding.Extensive weather-sealing, including enhanced sealing around the battery cover, terminal cover, and chassis joints, has been employed to resist dust and moisture for reliable operation in harsh weather conditions.Using the same NP-FZ100 battery as its predecessor, the a9 II's battery life is rated for approximately 500 shots per charge with the EVF or 690 shots with the rear LCD.Dual SD memory card slots allow for flexible file saving and handling and can be configured to partition raw and JPEG files or can be used for overflow recording. Both of the card slots are rated to support UHS-II memory cards for faster transfer speeds.A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port has been added, in addition to a micro-USB port, for faster, more reliable tethering support. The USB Type-C connection allows the camera to be charged from the host power source while connected.Integrated PC sync terminal for wired flash sync with strobe packs or wireless radio remotes.Durable shutter design has been tested for 500,000 actuations.Updated Multi Interface Shoe supports working with the optional ECM-B1M Shotgun Microphone or XLR-K3M XLR Adapter Kit, which provide improved, clear audio recording sound by sending a digital audio signal to the camera, opposed to an analog signal.The a9 II also features a 3.5mm microphone input jack for compatibility with external microphones.Compatible with optional VG-C4EM Vertical Grip.ConnectivityBuilt-in Wi-Fi enables the a9 II to instantly share imagery to mobile devices for direct sharing online, and support for both 2.4 and 5.0 GHz bands also enables wireless tethered shooting support. NFC (Near Field Communication) is also supported, which allows for one-touch connection between the camera and compatible mobile devices; no complex set-up is required. Once connected, the linked mobile device can also display a live view image on its screen and remotely control the camera's shutter.Bluetooth connectivity allows for location data acquisition.Integrated Ethernet port has been upgraded to 1000BASE-T speed for quick wired LAN sharing and remote operation.When working over a wired LAN, the Remote Camera Tool 2.1 app now has been enhanced for a reduced release time lag and live view delays as well as support for remote SD card formatting, FTP server switching, and changes to the still image storage destination. Wired or wireless LAN transfers can also occur in the background, while continuing to shoot.Imaging Edge Remote for desktop now supports the a9 II for PC Remote shooting via the Wi-Fi connection or tethered by the wired USB Type-C port. An updated data transfer control now makes it possible to transfer files from an SD card over Wi-Fi using the Imaging Edge Mobile app even when the camera is powered off.Transfer & Tagging add-on app can send FTP setting parameters from your mobile device to the camera, offers automatic data upload to an FTP server with attached metadata, and can perform automatic voice-to-text conversion.Voice Memos can be recorded in conjunction with still images and allow for attaching up to 60-second-long sound recordings to individual images. Saved as WAV audio files, these memos can be attached to files and played when the images are reviewed. Using the Transfer & Tagging add-on on a smartphone, you can automatically or manually convert this audio into text to be embedded in the image's metadata.Up to 10 distinct FTP settings can be saved and stored to an SD card, or up to 20 different settings can be saved via the Imaging Edge Mobile app.UHD 4K Video Recording in XAVC S FormatInternal recording of UHD 4K movies is possible in multiple frame rates up to 30 fps and, based on the Super35mm recording area and effective 6K resolution, oversampling renders greater detail and full pixel readout is possible, that is void of pixel binning, for higher quality imagery with reduced moiré and aliasing. Full-frame 4K recording has also been dramatically improved for improved quality when working at mid to high sensitivities to permit full use of the entire sensor width. Full HD 1080p recording is also supported in frame rates up to 120 fps, and both resolutions utilize the 100 Mbps XAVC S format contained within an MP4 wrapper with 4:2:0 sampling. The high-speed, 120 fps recording also enables 4x and 5x slow-motion movie recording with the frame rate set to either 30p or 24p.

A constant f/4 aperture makes operation smooth and consistent throughout the zoom range. The lens further benefits from the use of one extra-low dispersion element and five aspherical elements to combat aberrations as well as a Zeiss T* anti-reflective coating to keep flare and ghosting to an absolute minimum. The lens is fast to focus as well due to the linear autofocus motor and an internal focus design. Additionally, the dust- and moisture-resistant lens is equipped with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization to reduce the effects of camera shake, and it has a seven-blade circular diaphragm for smooth bokeh.Based on the Zeiss Tessar optical concept, this lens uses a design with 12 elements in ten groups that helps ensure a smaller overall lens size along with reduced flaring, distortion, and chromatic aberrations.Covering wide-angle to short telephoto perspectives, this compact 24-70mm can quickly become a go-to lens for Sony's full-frame E-mount cameras. It can also be used on APS-C format cameras where it will provide a 36-105mm equivalent zoom range.A constant f/4 maximum aperture offers consistent performance throughout the zoom range and also lends greater control over focus position for shallow depth of field techniques.Zeiss T* anti-reflective coatings have been applied to each lens surface to help minimize reflections in order to provide greater image clarity, contrast, and color fidelity.One extra-low dispersion glass element is featured in the lens design to help reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing for improved clarity and color neutrality.Five aspherical elements are incorporated in the lens design to reduce astigmatism, field curvature, coma, and other monochromatic aberrations.Optical SteadyShot image stabilization helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper imagery when shooting handheld with slower shutter speeds. This stabilization system can also be combined with select camera's sensor-shift type image stabilization for more effective control of camera blur.A linear autofocus motor and internal focus design provide quick and precise autofocus performance and enables accurate and silent focusing while recording videos.Dust- and moisture-sealed design better permits working in inclement conditions and rubberized control rings benefit handling in colder temperatures.Rounded seven-blade diaphragm contributes to a pleasing bokeh quality when employing selective focus techniques.In the Box",798.00,USD,,1579130

Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in your body deplete over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinol and shilajitThe traditional form of CoQ10, ubiquinone, is difficult for the body to absorb. But another form, ubiquinol, has been shown to absorb up to 8 times greater than ubiquinone. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system with superior absorption levels.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie shilajit is an adaptogen shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into ATP — the main source of cellular energy.12-17 When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, it has been clinically shown to double levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.18 Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form19,20 and facilitates greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.In middle-aged mice, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared to ubiquinone. In another preliminary study in mice, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain — 40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Breakthrough longevity and cellular energy formulaResearch supports the value of this unique combination of ubiquinol CoQ10 and shilajit. That's why we've created Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support, to create a powerful synergy that supports heart health and youthful cellular energy production better than CoQ10 alone.For younger consumers or people with no known heart health issues, we recommend a daily CoQ10 supplement with at least 100 mg of ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10. For older customers or those with heart health concerns, we recommend 200 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per day. We also offer 50 mg CoQ10 supplements for those who wish to take a lower dose or who wish to spread their CoQ10 intake throughout the day. This supplement contains 50 mg of ubiquinol CoQ10 per softgel.",20.15,EUR,,4830411

These elements, coupled with an advanced optical design, work to minimize sagittal coma flare and chromatic aberrations in order to provide high image sharpness and clarity. The lens' large diameter and floating system also help to correct for vignetting to ensure maintained peripheral brightness. A Super Multi Coating has been applied to lens elements, too, to reduce flare and ghosting for higher contrast and color fidelity. Additionally, making it an ideal lens for portraiture, the bright f/1.4 maximum aperture pairs with a rounded nine-blade diaphragm to benefit selective focus and shallow depth of field imaging with smooth bokeh.Complementing the imaging capabilities, the lens sports a Hyper Sonic Motor to produce quick, smooth, and quiet autofocus performance with full-time manual focus override. The physical design utilizes Thermally Stable Composite material for durability in a wide range of environments, and a brass bayonet mount also offers rigidity and mounting precision.As part of the Art line within Sigma's Global Vision series, this lens is designed to achieve truly notable optical performance and is ideally suited for creative and artistic applications.Prime normal-length lens is designed for full-frame Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras, however it can also be used with APS-C models where it will provide a 75mm equivalent focal length.Bright f/1.4 maximum aperture is well-suited for working in low-light conditions and also provides greater control over the focus position when using shallow depth of field techniques.Three Special Low Dispersion (SLD) elements are featured in the optical design, and help to reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations for improved clarity and color accuracy.One aspherical element reduces distortion and spherical aberrations for improved sharpness and accurate rendering.A Super Multi-Layer Coating has been applied to lens elements in order to minimize lens flare and ghosting and contribute to producing contrast-rich and color-neutral imagery, even in backlit conditions.Nine-blade rounded diaphragm contributes to a smooth and pleasing bokeh quality.The integrated HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) realizes quick and quiet autofocusing, which is further complemented by an optimized AF algorithm to produce smoother focusing performance. The HSM also permits full-time manual focus control simply by rotating the focus ring at any time.The lens is constructed using a Thermally Stable Composite (TSC) material, along with traditional metals, for greater precision and use in wide temperature variations.The bayonet mount is constructed from brass for ensured accuracy and durability.

Decades of research substantiate saw palmetto as the gold standard in natural prostate support.The saw palmetto berry (Serenoa repens) is rich in bioactive, high-molecular weight compounds including beta-sitosterol. It has been shown to interfere with DHT activity in the prostate, inhibit alpha-adrenergic receptor activity (to support normal urinary flow), and help regulate inflammatory actions in the prostate gland.Super Saw Palmetto/Nettle Root Formula with Beta-Sitosterol combines saw palmetto with a nettle root extract, boron, and rosemary to support a healthy prostate. Testosterone converts to estrogen at higher rates as men age. Prostate cells are sensitive to estrogen's growth stimulatory effects.

WD Red = NAS.Desktop hard drives are designed for optimum performance and reliability in a desktop personal computer. Although they are an affordable alternative to enterprise-class drives, desktop drives have a higher level of risk for potential data loss and failure in an always-on RAID configured NAS system. Specific issues that you may experience using desktop drives in a NAS or RAID environment include:Compatibility: Desktop hard drives are not always tested for compatibility in NAS and can present problems during integration.Reliability: Most desktop drives are not designed for the high operating temperatures or for 24x7 operating environments making them less reliable when used in a NAS system.Error recovery controls: Desktop drives are not traditionally designed for RAID environments and have controls that prevent the RAID controller from assisting in the event of an error which can cause the hard drive to drop off the RAID after a period of time. Rebuilding a RAID often requires several hours and can have a significant impact on downtime and productivity.Noise and vibration: Typically designed for single drive applications, average desktop drives are not optimized for multi-drive systems which have higher noise and vibration levels. When these drives are added to a NAS, the additional vibration can reduce the reliability and life span of the drive.Beyond the Desktop with NASwareWD Red drives include WD's exclusive NASware technology that addresses many of the challenges a traditional desktop hard drive has in a NAS system. WD works directly with our partners to test compatibility and reduce our customer's guess work as to which drive is right for their NAS system. Designed to deliver a better customer experience in small NAS systems, this innovative firmware finely balances the most important attributes of performance, power, and reliability in multiple drive environments. The unique algorithms in NASware optimize power and performance without compromising on the attributes that NAS-system owners value.Save power and moneyNASware further improves drive reliability and protects your data in the event of a power loss or disruption. Optimized power usage of WD Red drives results in significant power savings and lower hard drive operating temperatures within a small NAS environment, improving the overall reliability and performance of the drive and reduces the NAS cost of ownership.Intelligent Error RecoveryWith built in intelligent error recovery controls, NASware also prevents hard drives from being dropped off the RAID due to extended error recovery. This feature provides more availability and less down time when rebuilding the RAID.Command CompletionTo further improve reliability, NASware minimizes the data corruption or loss in the event of an unexpected power loss by completing the command in process before shutting down.Important Features for System IntegratorsIn addition to features that make WD Red™ drives perfect for populating or upgrading NAS systems, NASware brings features that system integrators need when building specialized NAS systems.Streaming Support- NASware provides built-in compatibility with the ATA Streaming Feature Set, which is important for AV storage applications such as Windows Media Center.SMART Command Transport (SCT) support- NASware allows monitoring and measuring of drive performance via the SMART command set. SMART can return data like thermal profiles, drive access statistics and more. NASware also delivers temperature accuracy within 1°C.Power Management Support- Enables optimized power usage within the NAS system and protects your data in the event of a power loss or disruption.BIC Performance- Optimized seek to provide BIC performance while reducing the power and acoustics.",184.95,AUD,,3739357

Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is formulated with a highly bioavailable ubiquinol form of coenzyme Q10 and augmented with the adaptogen PrimaVie® shilajit, which is shown to further increase CoQ10 absorption, promote cardiovascular health and help promote youthful cellular energy production.Your heart cells need CoQ10—but so do your other organs. That’s why CoQ10 is also highly concentrated in your brain, liver and kidneys.CoQ10 BenefitsPromotes cellular energy production, especially in the high-energy organs such as the brain, the liver, kidneys & the heartContains ultra-absorbable ubiquinol CoQ10 augmented with PrimaVie® shilajit to promote mitochondrial CoQ10 absorption to support greater cellular energy outputProvides powerful cardiovascular & antioxidant supportOffers a way to offset natural CoQ10 depletion over timeCoQ10 for heart health and cellular energyCoQ10 (or coenzyme Q10) is an essential nutrient your body requires for healthy mitochondrial function, a process that produces body energy at the cellular level. Because of this, it makes sense that CoQ10 is concentrated in high-energy organs such as your brain, liver, kidneys and your heart.CoQ10 also has powerful antioxidant properties, protecting important proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage.Unfortunately, CoQ10 levels in the body decrease over time.Improved bioavailability: ubiquinolThe traditional ubiquinone form of CoQ10 is difficult for the body to absorb. That's why Life Extension offers a highly bioavailable form of ubiquinol CoQ10 in a patented delivery system shown to absorb up to 8 times better than ubiquinone. In people taking this form of ubiquinol, high levels of plasma CoQ10 can be achieved in only four weeks.Shilajit enhances CoQ10 effectivenessPrimaVie® shilajit has been shown to promote mitochondrial metabolism, helping mitochondria convert fats and sugars into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main source of cellular energy. When combined with ubiquinol CoQ10, shilajit doubles levels of CoQ10 in the mitochondria.Shilajit prolongs CoQ10's efficacy at the cellular level by stabilizing it in its ubiquinol form and promotes greater cellular energy output by improving delivery of CoQ10 into the mitochondria.CoQ10 and agingIn a pre-clinical model, ubiquinol was up to 40% more effective at slowing measurements of aging compared with ubiquinone. In another pre-clinical study, the combination of CoQ10 and shilajit produced a 56% increase in cellular energy production in the brain—40% better than CoQ10 alone. Muscle tissue saw a 144% increase, which was 27% better than with CoQ10 by itself.Do your part for a healthy heartSuper Ubiquinol CoQ10 with Enhanced Mitochondrial Support™ is a powerful formula for heart health and youthful cellular energy support.

21075521,,FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens,"The FUJIFILM Aspherical Super EBC XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR Macro Lens s a 122mm equivalent telephoto prime for X-mount mirrorless cameras. The long focal length coupled with the f/2.8 maximum aperture is well-suited to isolating subject matter, especially when paired with the short 9.8\"" minimum focusing distance, and a 1:1 life-size magnification is ideal for macro shooting. A Floating Focus System benefits close-up work by using two distinct focusing groups in order to maintain image quality throughout the focus range, and a linear motor ensures quick, quiet autofocus performance. Additionally, a five stop-effective optical image stabilization system complements making sharp imagery by minimizing the appearance of camera shake. In regard to the optical design, this lens employs one aspherical element and four low dispersion elements to realize sharp, clear imagery void of both chromatic and spherical aberrations. A Super EBC coating has also been applied to suppress flare and ghosting when working in bright and backlit conditions. Additionally, enabling the lens's use in harsh environments, it is weather-sealed and also features a fluorine coating on the front element to guard against moisture, smudging, and dust. Key Features Short telephoto prime lens is designed for APS-C-format FUJIFILM X-mount mirrorless cameras and provides a 122mm equivalent focal length. Macro lens affords a life-size 1:1 magnification ratio along with a 9.8\"" minimum focusing distance for working with close-up subjects. Four extra-low dispersion elements, including one Super ED element, are used to greatly reduce color fringing and chromatic aberrations in order to produce high clarity and color fidelity. One aspherical element controls distortion, curvature of field, and spherical aberrations, which helps to improve sharpness and realize more accurate rendering. Super EBC coating has been applied to individual elements to reduce lens flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color fidelity when working in strong lighting conditions. Floating Focus System employs two distinct groups of focusing elements for faster performance as maintained image quality throughout the focusing range. Linear motor autofocus system delivers smooth, near-silent performance that is especially beneficial to video applications and when working in noise-sensitive areas. Focus range limiter switch allows you to constrain the focus range to between 9.8\"" to 1.6', 1.6' to infinity, or for the whole 9.8\"" to infinity range for more responsive focusing depending on the distance to your subject.

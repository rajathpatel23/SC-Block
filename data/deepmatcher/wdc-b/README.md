# Web Data Commons Block

We propose Web Data Commons Block (WDC-B) a new large-scale
benchmark dataset for blocking that allows for a more realistic setup
to evaluate blockers. The basis for this dataset is the large, pairwise,
80% corner cases and 20% random dataset with the half-seen
test set from WDC Products: [a multi-dimensional Entity Matching Benchmark](https://webdatacommons.org/largescaleproductcorpus/wdc-products/).

In this folder we share table A,
table B, a small version of table B without the additional product
offers from the WDC Product Corpus and the ground truth split
into train, validation and test.
